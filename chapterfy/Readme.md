#### Project Description
### Chapterfy
Chapterfy adds video chapter details to videos by crowdsourcing.

Video chapter details are important for viewers to get a idea of the video content without watching it completely. Specially in tutorial videos chapter details are very useful for viewers. But adding chapters is a time consuming task. Chapterfy gives a solution to this by crowdsourcing the chapter details. Chapterfy allow content creators to create a crowdsource campaign easily by using Effect Network.
