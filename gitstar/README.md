Code Amongst the Stars

*Effect Hackathon project*

## Team name

GitStar

## Team Members

- Sjoerd Dijkstra

## Project Description

Have the Github users from the Effect Network interact and with you open source repositories to get more traction. The Effect workforce allows projects to easily tap into a fitting audience for their Github pages.

## Summary

GitStar a pure Effect Network dApp with some unique features:

- The requester account is a [smart contract](https://jungle3.bloks.io/account/gitgitgitgit)
- The contract any Effect account to order stars (requester private key not required!)
- Progress bar that indicates every step needed to publish a task
- Useful Effect template that uses Github API
- Has an embedded revenue model, as the smart contract collects a fee

GitStar maintains its own smart contract in combination with the Effect qualification system to track credible workers with real Github account (GitStar is not a click farm!).
