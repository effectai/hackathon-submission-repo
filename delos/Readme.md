#### Project Description
Living in El Salvador ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡», a small country in Central America, we have seing a huge oportunity in Blockchain as a means to solve a lot of technological problems, not just for my country but for the world. The president of El Salvador launched a wallet called Chivo with a lot of technological flaws, one of those problems is the nonexistent KYC verification proccess which lead to millions of accounts been compromised or even stolen.

That problem inspired us to create a tool called delos. It allows anyone to submit a Document and using the amazing Effect Workforce, we categorize the data from the image and validate if it is in fact a useful document.

#### Summary
**delos** allows our users to create campaigns using our UI, specifically thought for image labeling tasks, and using the Effect Workforce ðŸ¦¾, we retrive very useful information for our customers. In the future, we want to allow our users to access an API and dynamically consult if the information they provided is valid ðŸ’¥.
